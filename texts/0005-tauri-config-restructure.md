-   Feature Name: tauri_config_restructure
-   Start Date: 2023-12-20
-   RFC PR: [`tauri-apps/rfcs#13`](HTTPS://github.com/tauri-apps/rfcs/pull/13)

# Summary

Restructuring the `tauri.conf.json` for more simplicity, consistency and
clarity.

# Motivation

The current `tauri.conf.json` has a bunch of objects that don't necessarily
follow a rule that could reason why they exist there and thus makes it awkward
to figure out where to add new fields for example `tauri > bundle` object is a
configuration for the CLI, why does it exist inside `tauri` object, another
example is the `plugins` object which is a tauri feature, why does it exist
outside of `tauri` object? These inconsistencies will make it harder to add new
fields to the config.

# Guide-level explanation

-   Unpack `package` fields to the root object.
-   Rename `tauri` object to `app`.
-   Move `tauri > bundle > identifier` to the root object as it is used by other
    places in tauri other than bundling.
-   Remove `bundle > updater` as the only useful key it has, is `pubkey` field
    and that should be moveed to `plugin > updater > pubkey`. This will require
    changes in the CLI to only sign the bundles when `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
    key is set . This will also fix a huge DX when using `tauri-plugin-updater`
    and you endup having to configure updater-related configs once in
    `bundle > updater` and `plugin > updater`.
-   Move `build > withGlobalTauri` to the new `app > withGlobaltauri` object.
-   Move `tauri > pattern` to `app > security > pattern` and make it accept a
    simple string for `brownfield`.
-   Move `tauri > cli` and `tauri > update` fields to `plugins > cli` and
    `plugins > update` as they are plugins now.
-   Rename `build > distDir` to `build > frontendDist` to explicitly set the
    intent of the option.
-   Rename `build > devPath` to `build > devUrl` and only accept urls, if users
    don't have a devServer, they should remove this field and only set
    `build > frontendDist` which will make the CLI start its built-in devServer
    or fallback to embed the assets if `--no-dev-server` is used.
-   Move `tauri > bundle` to root object.

## Community Considerations

This will be a breaking change and so users will need to restructure the config
themselves or rely on `tauri migrate` command.

# Drawbacks

Almost all current Tauri users will need to migrate to the new breaking changes
but it is better to do this now in a major release.
